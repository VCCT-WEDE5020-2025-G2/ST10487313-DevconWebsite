## SEO Implementation Notes

### Meta Keywords
While meta keywords have been implemented in this project to meet assignment requirements, 
it's important to note that they are no longer used by major search engines for ranking 
purposes. Google officially stopped using meta keywords for web ranking in September 2009. 
The tag was deprecated due to widespread abuse through keyword stuffing and other major search engines (Yahoo, Bing) followed.

**Currently:**
- Google: Does not use (confirmed 2009)
- Bing: Does not use (confirmed 2014)

**Modern SEO Focus:**
Instead of meta keywords, modern SEO best practices emphasise:

- Proper heading structure (H1-H6)
- Meta descriptions (for click-through rates)
- Alt text for images
- Page load speed and mobile responsiveness

## Changelog  
- **v1.0 (Initial Submission):** Project setup, content research, wireframes, README created.  
- **v1.1 (Part 2 Submission):** Licensing details added, footer corrected, external stylesheet implemented, CSS styling applied (base, typography, layout, and visual styles), responsive testing performed.
